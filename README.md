*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by moabed*

## Description

A program named *fract'ol* designed to render two complex numbers equations, which are Julia and Mandlebrot sets , using minilibx library.

## Instructions

On the same project repository, open the terminal and prompt

- make

it will compile the project files and libraries into an executable named *fractol*

Then to test if mandlebrot set works prompt

- ./fractol mandlebrot

Or if you choose to test julia set

- ./fractol julia "real" "imaginary"

## AI Usage

In this project, AI was used wisely in error handling to check every case of failure, beside finding the optimal color equations to paint the sets , also explained for me the scaling method.
